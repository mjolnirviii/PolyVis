# PolyVis
Create and view polyrhythms

Summer Qt project 
Desktop application that allows you to create and listen to polyrhythms. Concentric polygons of different colors, with number of corners representing the number of beats and balls that move along the edges are used as visualization.

Work still in progress, sound still not working and garbage collection not implemented yet.
